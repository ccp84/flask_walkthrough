                <p class="lead">Hi! I'm Ian, I've recently qualified as a Level 3 Sports Massage Therapist.
                    After 30+ years of working in the packaging industry, it's time for a change of direction!
                    I took up running about 9 years ago and have completed a number of marathons, half marathons,
                    mud runs and obstacle course races in that time. I'm also a member of The Malvern Joggers, who I've
                    run with for the last 5 or 6 years. Still working full time at the moment and fitting the Sports
                    Massage in around that, so I'm currently available for massage after 17:00 Mon - Thurs, after 12:00
                    on Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday races permitted.</p>
