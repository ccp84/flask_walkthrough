        "news_item": "Don't over do it!! Over use and over training injuries are one of the most common complaints I deal with. The old adage 'No Pain! No Gain!' is now an outdated concept. You don't need to be in pain!! Discomfort and minor aches are OK... But if it really hurts, stop. REST. 3 times a week for 1 activity is plenty, aith alternate 'rest' days, remember muscles can only recover, repair and adapt to new exercise while they rest. If you are working the same muscle groups every day this doesnt happen. If you absolutely MUST exercise every day, cross train, try mixing in swimming, cycling, gym, whatever else you can think of. Just don't for eample run 2 consecutive days then go to the gym and work legs the next day. (You know who you are). If anyone would like any advice on their training plans or goals, feel free to drop me a message or catch up with me after Malvern Joggers on a Wednesday at Malvern Rugby Club."

The new rate will be £45 a session, (of course my original first 10 clients will keep their introductory rate for this year). I hope that you have all recovered from your Christmas and New Year festivities. And have been making New Year resolutions to be more active and healhty...
